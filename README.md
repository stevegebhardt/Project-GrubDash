# Project GrubDash

The background for this porject is that I have been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, I have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.

In this project I will have done the following:
*Ran tests from the command line.
*Used common middleware packages.
*Received requests through routes.
*Accessed relevant information through route parameters.
*Built an API following RESTful design principles.
*Wrote custom middleware functions.

HTML and CSS edits are not required for this project.
